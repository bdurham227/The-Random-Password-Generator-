### Password Generator
<a name="desc"></a>
## 1. Description
​
This password generator web application was created using pre-built HTML and CSS. For this assignment, I wrote the javascript to make the application fucntion.
​
When the user opens the web application page, and clicks the "Generate Password" button, they will then receieve a prompt to enter a number between 8 and 128. If the number chosen is outside of those parameters, or if a letter/special charcter is chosen, the user will receive an alert that those choices are not valid and they will have to start over.
​
After the users selects a number within the defined paramters, they will receive four additional prompts: one to include uppercase letters, one to include lowercase letters, one to include special characters, and one to include numbers.
​
If the user clicks "Cancel" to the four additional prompts, they will receive an alert telling telling them they need to select at least one of the promps.
​
Finally, the password will appear within the text box, and the user can then copy this password to the clipboard.
